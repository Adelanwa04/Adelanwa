    "My knowledge on data analysis has helped me to load and clean this data from its raw form that contains irrelevant columns,missing values and the irregularity in data type. Explore and communicate interesting insights with different kind of plots and statistical inferences using Pandas,Numpy and Matplotlib. This has enable me to easily solve some interesting questions which was listed at the beginning of this analysis using fact from the data. Background Checks was officially launched in 1998 and since then,there is a steady progressing of gun purchase through the years. We noticed gun was less purchased in 2014 compared to 2 years before because there was an amended regulation in 2014 which ultimately causes the sudden change. This was also noticed in 2017,Over the years, we can see there's a preference for Long guns except in 2016 where hand gun made more purchases. Other kinds of gun has been relatively low in purchases compared to others."
