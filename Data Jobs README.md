# Summary of Findings

I was to able discover the average salary of data jobs, Data Architects had the highest average salaries of 139,978 with Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists making 125,048 and 102,217 on average respectively. Salaries differ with the company's location, Russia allocated more salaries for data jobs on average with 157,500 with United States next in line with 145,059 then Japan's 135,922. Overall, Data Engineers earn around 600,000 on average with Data Scientists and Data Analyst earning around 450,000.

As data enthusiasts looking for opportunities, companies in United States, Germany, India, United Kingdom, France and Canada are the places to find such opportunities. Remote work model is much appreciated for the past few years now and United States, India, and Germany are open to offer such opportunities to data enthusiasts the most but the salary also tells a different story. United States pay more for remote workers, earning around 147,000 on average, India pay remote workers the least with 20,335 on average and Germany pay remote workers just enough with around 86,000.

From my analysis, companies only offer remote opportunities to certain countries which means an employee residence/country can affect what kind of opportunities they can get specifically remote jobs. Companies in the same continent tend to favour each other with these opportunities.
